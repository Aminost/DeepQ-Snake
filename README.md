# Snake Game with Deep Q-Learning

This project implements the classic Snake game using Deep Q-Learning (DQN) with Pygame and PyTorch.

## Overview

The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around a grid, eating apples to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls. In this project, we use Deep Q-Learning to train an AI agent to play the Snake game autonomously.

## Features

- Snake game implementation with Pygame.
- Deep Q-Network (DQN) model using PyTorch.
- Training loop with Q-Learning algorithm.
- Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy.
- Optimization with mini-batch gradient descent.
- Testing mode to evaluate the trained model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- PyTorch

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Aminost/DeepQ-Snake.git
